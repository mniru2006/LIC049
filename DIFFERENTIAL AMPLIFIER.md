### **"Differential Amplifier"**

A differential amplifier is a fundamental building block in analog circuit design, widely used in applications such as signal amplification, noise reduction, and data acquisition systems. It amplifies the difference between two input signals while rejecting common-mode noise, making it ideal for high-precision circuits, including operational amplifiers and analog front-end systems.

In modern electronics, differential amplifiers play a crucial role in communication systems, biomedical instrumentation, and sensor interfaces, where signal integrity is critical. The ability to suppress external interference and unwanted signals makes them superior to single-ended amplifiers in noisy environments.

from the calculation we have finded Iss value as 1mA <br>
Id1 and Id2 as 0.5mA <br>
Rd as 1.9kohm <br>
Rss as 400ohm <br>

Vov = vgs - vth = 0.8v - 0.366v = 0.434v <br>

### **Analysis**

**Increase Vicm from 1.2v to 1.3v and observe Vocm and Vp** <br>
| **Common-Mode Input Voltage (V_ICM)** | **Output Voltage (V_out)** | **Voltage at Point P (V_P)** |
|--------------------------------------|--------------------------|--------------------------|
| **1.2V**                            | **1.24836V**             | **0.4V**                |
| **1.3V**                            | **1.1V**                 | **0.46V**               |

### Effect of VICM on Vout and VP

As the common-mode input voltage \( VICM \) increases, the source voltage \( VP \) also increases, causing a shift in the operating point. This leads to a higher drain current, resulting in a greater voltage drop across \( RD \), which reduces \( Vout \).

# Inference:  

This experiment explored differential amplifier configurations: resistor-based, current source-based, and NMOS-based, each affecting gain, bandwidth, and stability differently.  

- Resistor: High bandwidth, low gain, low CMRR.  
- Current source: High gain, high CMRR, slightly lower bandwidth.  
- NMOS (CMOSN): Highest gain.  

 Best Configuration Based on Need:  
1. High bandwidth → Resistor  
2. Maximum gain→ NMOS (CMOSN)  
3. Better CMRR→ Current source or NMOS (CMOSN)
